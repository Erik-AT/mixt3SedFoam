The following changes have been applied to the solver after running this case:

Ueqn:
		+ turbulence->divDevRhoReff(U)

		//Adding contribution of solid shear stress tensor separately 
		- fvm::laplacian(gamma*mup, U)
		- fvc::div((gamma*mup*dev2(T(fvc::grad(U)))))
	
	replaced by:

		- fvm::laplacian(muEff, U)
		- fvc::div(muEff * dev2(T(fvc::grad(U))))

Weqn:

		Wi*= neg(mag(gradpsf & gUnit) - alphad*(rhod-rhoc)*mag(g));

	replaced by (but has no effect):

		gradpNet = mag(gradpsf & gUnit) - alphad*(rhod-rhoc)*mag(g);
		Wi*= neg(gradpNet);	

Also When I tried to change the m to n in drift flux drag model it cuase difference in the results
while it shouldn't. So, I kept it unchanged
